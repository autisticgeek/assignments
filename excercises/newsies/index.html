                    <h2>Bug in HP Remote Management Tool leaves servers open to attack.</h2>
                    <h4>by Tom Spring</h4>
                    <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise has patched a vulnerability in its remote management hardware called Integrated
                        Lights-Out 3 that is used in its popular line of HP ProLiant servers. The bug allows an attacker
                        to launch an unauthenticated remote denial of service attack that could contribute to a crippling
                        on vulnerable datacenters under some conditions.</p>
                    <p>The vulnerability (CVE-2017-8987) is rated “high severity”, with a CVSS base score of 8.6, and was discovered
                        by Rapid7 researchers in September. HPE publicly reported the bug on Feb. 22 and has made patches
                        available.
                    </p>
                    <p>Affected is the v1.88 firmware for HPE’s Integrated Lights-Out 3 (iLO3). Not impacted are newer versions
                        of the firmware (1.8, 1.82, 1.85, and 1.87) along with firmware for iLO4 (v2.55). iLO5 devices were
                        not tested, according to a Rapid7 technical brief on the vulnerability written by Sam Huckins, the
                        company’s program manager.</p>

                    <h2>Sophisticated RedDrop Malware Targets Android Phones</h2>
                    <h4>by Lindsey O'Donnell</h4>
                    <p>A sophisticated strain of mobile malware targeting Android devices can extract sensitive data and audio
                        recordings, run up premium SMS charges and then tries to extort money from victims.</p>
                    <p>According to security firm Wandera the malware, dubbed RedDrop, is being distributed inside 53 Android
                        applications promoted on third-party app stores. Apps range from image editors, calculators, language
                        learning tools and adult themed apps. According to Wandera, the criminals had targeted victims working
                        at several“Big Four” consultancy firms.</p>
                    <p>“RedDrop is one of the most sophisticated pieces of Android malware that we have seen in broad distribution,”
                        said Wandera in an overview of its research published Wednesday. “Not only does the attacker utilize
                        a wide range of functioning malicious applications to entice the victim, they’ve also perfected every
                        tiny detail to ensure their actions are difficult to trace.”</p>

                    <h2>Ad network circumvents ad-blocking tools to run in-browser cryptojacker scripts</h2>
                    <h4>by Lindsey O'Donnell</h4>
                    <p>Cryptojackers are getting resourceful and have figured out how to bypass ad-blocking software and deliver
                        the Coinhive JavaScript miner via browser-based ads. Researchers at Qihoo’s Netlab 360 said it recently
                        spotted an advertising network that was using what is called a domain generation algorithm tool to
                        evade ad-blocking tools and serve up ads that link to landing pages that contain the cryptominer
                        Coinhive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Researchers are not identifying the ad network, but they said that since 2017 the provider has used domain
                        generation algorithms (DGA) to effectively circumvent ad blockers. </p>
                    <p>“Starting from 2017-12, the bar got raised again and we began to see these DGA.popad domains participating
                        in cryptojacking without end-users acknowledgement,” Zhang Zaifeng, researcher with Netlab 360, wrote
                        in a post.</p>
