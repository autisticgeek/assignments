                <h2>Bug in HP Remote Management Tool leaves servers open to attack.</h2>
                <h4>by Tom Spring</h4>
                <article>

                    <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise has patched a vulnerability in its remote management hardware called Integrated
                        Lights-Out 3 that is used in its popular line of HP ProLiant servers. The bug allows an attacker
                        to launch an unauthenticated remote denial of service attack that could contribute to a crippling
                        on vulnerable datacenters under some conditions.</p>
                    <p>The vulnerability (CVE-2017-8987) is rated “high severity”, with a CVSS base score of 8.6, and was discovered
                        by Rapid7 researchers in September. HPE publicly reported the bug on Feb. 22 and has made patches
                        available.
                    </p>
                    <p>Affected is the v1.88 firmware for HPE’s Integrated Lights-Out 3 (iLO3). Not impacted are newer versions
                        of the firmware (1.8, 1.82, 1.85, and 1.87) along with firmware for iLO4 (v2.55). iLO5 devices were
                        not tested, according to a Rapid7 technical brief on the vulnerability written by Sam Huckins, the
                        company’s program manager.</p>
                    <p>The Hewlett-Packard iLO is an embedded server management technology for ProLiant servers that consists
                        of a physical card with a separate network connection. It allows system administrators to remotely
                        manage servers.</p>
                    <p>“An attacker who has already compromised a network can now can easily lock out an admin from fixing or
                        mitigating against an attack,” said Tod Beardsley, Rapid7’s research director. “An attacker can use
                        this to make a data center go dark and keep it that way by locking out remote management and mitigation.”
                        Alternatively, system administrators will have to tackle on-premises fixes.</p>
                    <p>According to Beardsley, an attacker sharing the same network as a vulnerable iLO3 can simply send several
                        HTTP requests and cause the iLO3 device (running firmware v1.88) to stop responding for up to 10
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>One of those examples includes using a Secure Socket Shell where an “open sessions will become unresponsive;
                        new SSH sessions will not be established.” In another scenario with a web portal “users cannot log
                        into the web portal; the login page will not successfully load,” according to Rapid7.</p>
                    <p>Where as HTTP GET and POST requests are benign, curl -X OPTIONS request to an iLO3 device can trigger
                        the DoS condition. “Any method requested other than GET or POST will trigger the DoS, even invalid
                        ones,” Beardsley wrote. “Ten minutes after the DoS is triggered, the watchdog (automatic system recovery)
                        service restarts the device.”</p>
                    <p>“An attack doesn’t require authentication. The device itself requires some kind of authentication, such
                        as a web portal that you use to like login. But this attack comes in before that. The attack is literally
                        just an HTTP command,” Beardsley said.</p>
                    <p>According to Rapid7, HP’s Integrated Lights-Out is not on by default, which likely disqualifies many
                        ProLiant from the vulnerability</p>

                <h2>Sophisticated RedDrop Malware Targets Android Phones</h2>
                <h4>by Lindsey O'Donnell</h4>
                <article>

                    <p>A sophisticated strain of mobile malware targeting Android devices can extract sensitive data and audio
                        recordings, run up premium SMS charges and then tries to extort money from victims.</p>
                    <p>According to security firm Wandera the malware, dubbed RedDrop, is being distributed inside 53 Android
                        applications promoted on third-party app stores. Apps range from image editors, calculators, language
                        learning tools and adult themed apps. According to Wandera, the criminals had targeted victims working
                        at several“Big Four” consultancy firms.</p>
                    <p>“RedDrop is one of the most sophisticated pieces of Android malware that we have seen in broad distribution,”
                        said Wandera in an overview of its research published Wednesday. “Not only does the attacker utilize
                        a wide range of functioning malicious applications to entice the victim, they’ve also perfected every
                        tiny detail to ensure their actions are difficult to trace.”</p>
                    <p>Wandera told Threatpost it’s unsure how many Android devices may be infected with the malware. “One thing
                        we have noticed is that the pace of attempted infections appears to be accelerating,” Wandera said.
                        Since the company initially identified the malware, the company has blocked roughly 20 further requests
                        by infected apps to reach the criminal’s distribution network – where additional malware would be
                        downloaded from.</p>
                    <p>The apps are being promoted via ads displayed on the popular Chinese search engine Baidu. Researchers
                        said those who click on the ads are “taken to huxiawang[.]cn, the primary distribution site for the
                        attack. The landing pages that follow host various content to encourage and incite the user to download
                        one of the 53 apps within the RedDrop family of malicious apps.”</p>
                    <p>Once the RedDrop-infected apps are installed the program silently downloads an additional seven Android
                        application packages (APK) that add additional spyware and malicious components such as trojans,
                        premium SMS functionality and additional dropper software.</p>
                    <p>“When the user interacts with the app, each interaction secretly triggers the sending of an SMS to a
                        premium service, which is then instantly deleted before it can be detected,” the company said.</p>
                    <p>The rogue apps are capable of harvesting sensitive data, including passively recording audio of the device’s
                        surroundings, accessing photos, contacts, and extracting locally saved files.</p>
                    <p>Data siphoned off phones are uploaded to the attacker’s Dropbox account to be used in conjunction with
                        further attacks and for possible extortion purposes.</p>

                <h2>Ad network circumvents ad-blocking tools to run in-browser cryptojacker scripts</h2>
                <h4>by Lindsey O'Donnell</h4>
                <article>

                    <p>Cryptojackers are getting resourceful and have figured out how to bypass ad-blocking software and deliver
                        the Coinhive JavaScript miner via browser-based ads. Researchers at Qihoo’s Netlab 360 said it recently
                        spotted an advertising network that was using what is called a domain generation algorithm tool to
                        evade ad-blocking tools and serve up ads that link to landing pages that contain the cryptominer
                        Coinhive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Researchers are not identifying the ad network, but they said that since 2017 the provider has used domain
                        generation algorithms (DGA) to effectively circumvent ad blockers. </p>
                    <p>“Starting from 2017-12, the bar got raised again and we began to see these DGA.popad domains participating
                        in cryptojacking without end-users acknowledgement,” Zhang Zaifeng, researcher with Netlab 360, wrote
                        in a post.</p>

                    <h2>Inmate seriously injured in jail fight</h2>
                    <h4>By Donna Thornton</h4>
                    <article>
                        <p>An Etowah County inmate is charged with attempted murder after he seriously injured a cellmate in a fight Tuesday night, according to Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin.</p>
                        <p>Joshua McDonald, 25, had been booked into the Etowah County Detention Center Nov. 29, 2017, for a probation violation.</p>
                        <p>The inmate beaten during the fight Tuesday night was jailed for an unpaid traffic violation, according to Assistant Chief of Corrections Keith Peek and Lt. Brad Conaway.</p>
                        <p>The 25-year-old man remains hospitalized.</p>
                        <p>Entrekin said because of the seriousness of the victim’s injuries, the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office was called in to investigate. He said Cherokee County investigators obtained the warrant for attempted murder Thursday.</p>
                        <p>Entrekin said there were three men in the locked cell when the fight occurred. The third man was not involved in the altercation.</p>
                        <p>While Entrekin said he didn’t know all the details of Cherokee County’s investigation, he understands the fight was over a prior drug debt.</p>
